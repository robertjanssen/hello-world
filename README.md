# hello-world

Allright, this readme.md file is branched from the master branch.

This branch is called readme-edits. Unfortunately I don't see the branch name somewere on the screen ...

Wait, I discovered that on the bottom there is a branch name:

  "Commit directly to readme-edits branch"
  
  1-9-2017: A new description is added to this file.

Let's see if I can see the different versions of this file?
Can I compare the different versions and see what is added or changed?

I am going to commit it now!
